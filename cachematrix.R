## These functions provide a special list object to hold a matrix,
## and 'cache' the inverse of the matrix.
## a call to cachesolve on this object, will calculate the inverse if it hasn't 
## yet been or if the matrix has been changed since it was last calculated,
## otherwise the matrix inverse is retrieved from this object.

## makeCacheMatrix is used to 
##   set the matrix values
##   retrieve the matrix values
##   set the inverse of the matrix
##   retrieve the inverse of the matrix (if previously calculated)

        x_inv <- NULL

## A call to cacheSolve, checks to see if the inverse of 
## the matrix has been calculated since the last time the
## values of the matrix were set.  If so, the inverse is 
## retrieved, otherwise 'solve' is used to calculate the
## inverse.
